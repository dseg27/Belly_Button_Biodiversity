# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Purpose ## 
The purpose of this project was to complete a dashboard that hosts demographic and biological information for all the participants in the Improbable Beef study.
All participants can now filter the data on the site by their unique participant ID. Once filtered, the site displays visualizations that show the top 10 bacterial cultures found in their belly buttons, their belly button washing frequency, and a bubble chart showing bacterial cultures per sample. 

The website was customized by making it HTML mobile-responsive, adding a stock image to the jumbotron, and adding color to the background.
